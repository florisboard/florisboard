        Guide to a good crash-report:
        â€¢ Please search existing bug/crash reports to avoid creating duplicates.
        â€¢ Give your crash report a good name (no generics like "Error" or "Crash"), so others can easily identify the topic of your issue.
        â€¢ Describe what you were doing what could've led to the crash and whether the crash is random or reproducible.
