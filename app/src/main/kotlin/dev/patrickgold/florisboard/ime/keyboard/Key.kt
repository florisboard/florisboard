/**
 * Abstract class describing the smallest computed unit in a computed keyboard. Each key represents exactly one key
 * displayed in the UI. It allows to save the absolute location within the parent keyboard, save touch and visual
 * bounds, managing the state (enabled, pressed, visibility) as well as layout sizing factors. Each key in this IME
 * inherits from this base key class. This allows for a inter-operable usage of a key without knowing the exact
 * subclass upfront.
 *
 * @property data The base key data this key represents.This can be anything - from a basic text key to an emoji key
 *  to a complex selector.
