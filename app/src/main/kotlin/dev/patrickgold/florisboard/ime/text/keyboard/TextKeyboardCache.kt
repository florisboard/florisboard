/**
 * Helper class for caching computed text keyboards. Done to reduce the CPU strain and to reuse already allocated
 * objects. The cache stores the deferred results of the keyboard, meaning that it can contain keyboards which haven't
 * even finished computing. When getting a keyboard, the caller must always await the result thus. Additionally several
 * clear methods are provided to clear the cache either partially or completely.
 *
 * @param ioDispatcher The dispatcher for the IO channel. Defaults to [Dispatchers.IO].
