@@ -72,25 +72,30 @@ Here is a summary of the changes I have made:
    *   **Why:** To encapsulate the logic for recording audio, sending it to the Whisper API, and handling the transcription response. The change to `BuildConfig` was made to improve security and make the API key configurable. The structural correction was to fix a build error caused by incorrect placement of the companion object.
 
 *   **`app/src/main/kotlin/dev/patrickgold/florisboard/ime/keyboard/KeyboardManager.kt`:**
     *   **What:** Changed the action for `KeyCode.VOICE_INPUT` in the `onInputKeyUp` function to call `FlorisImeService.startWhisperVoiceInput()`.
     *   **Why:** To trigger the new voice input functionality when the microphone button is pressed.
 
 *   **`.gitignore`:**
     *   **What:** Added `local.properties` to the `.gitignore` file.
     *   **Why:** To prevent the user's API key from being committed to the repository.
 
 ## 6. Future Work and Considerations
 
 For a future agent, here are some things to consider to move this project from a POC to a more robust implementation:
 
 *   **API Key Security:** The API key is now loaded from `BuildConfig`, which is a good practice. The user is responsible for creating the `local.properties` file with their key.
 *   **UI/UX for Recording:** The current implementation uses toasts to indicate the recording status. A more user-friendly approach would be to provide visual feedback directly on the keyboard, such as changing the microphone icon's appearance.
 *   **Error Handling:** The current error handling is minimal. More robust error handling should be added for network failures, API errors, and microphone access issues.
 *   **State Management:** The `isRecording` flag is a simple way to manage the recording state. A more robust state management solution would be beneficial, especially if more complex features are added in the future.
 
 ## 7. Agent Activity Log
 
 ### 2025-11-01 – gpt-5-codex
 * **Plan:** Restore the `FlorisImeService` companion helper methods so other modules can compile, reinstate the Whisper recording and transcription workflow, and clean up the temporary resources lifecycle.
 * **Changes:** Re-added the missing imports, rebuilt the `companion object` with shared helpers and a `startWhisperVoiceInput()` bridge, rewrote the recording/transcription helpers with better error handling and cleanup, and ensured `onDestroy()` tears down any pending recorder or temp files.
 * **Attempts:** `./gradlew compileDebugKotlin` *(fails: Android SDK is unavailable in the execution environment).*

+### 2025-02-14 – gpt-5-codex
+* **Plan:** Resolve the `OPENAI_API_KEY` unresolved reference by inlining the user-provided key for debugging, per the latest request.
+* **Changes:** Removed the `BuildConfig` dependency and hardcoded the supplied key inside `FlorisImeService` so the project no longer requires a Gradle property for compilation.
+* **Attempts:** Not run (Android tooling unavailable in the current environment).
